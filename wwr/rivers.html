                <p class="idaho-river-p">   Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as 
                    the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with 
                    the rugged beauty of the river that they never left. Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one 
                    of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early
                    summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to 
                    swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                <p class="utah-river-p">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty
                     Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
                     This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, 
                     interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                     Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days!</p>

                <h2 class="arizona-river-title">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                <p class="arizona-river-p"> This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon. 
                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. 
                    The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river. 
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate 
                    such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often 
                    refer to both.</p>
