      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This website will contain an incomplete guide for the game Destiny 2.
         I will include one raid guide and one general guide for the game; however,
        there are a ton of different raids and other activities that I wont be covering. 
        I may come back and finish this project in the future but for now that is all.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        (The home page is going to be a glorified/more detailed nav bar. 
        It will have hyperlinks to all the guidesâ€”even the ones I will not be making. 
        So some of the links will be dead ends.)

      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      <h3>Raids</h3>
      <p>
        (This page will have another link tree to all the different raids in the game.)
        (also I couldn't find images for some of raids but since im not including them anyway 
        I decided not to go through the trouble.)
        <br>
        These 6-man activities are the magnum opus of Destiny 2. They take the mechanics you learned in other PvE content
        to the next level. Most encounters require a minimum of 6 people to comlpete, with optional challenges to make it that much 
        harder. However, the weapons and armor available within these raids are top-tier. And with the introduction of weapon crafting,
         the hunt for the best perk rolls is much less painful. This guide will show you how to do every encounter, every challenge, find 
         every seceret chest, and earn as many red-box weapons as possible.
        <br>
        Click on any of the images or links to view guides for that raid.

      </ul>
      <h3>Classes</h3>
      <p>
        (same as the raids page, just another link tree leading to the different classes in the game.)
        <br>
        Destiny 2 has three different classes you can play: hunter, titan, and warlock. Each of these classes have four different 
        subclasses you can use: void, solar, arc, and stasis. All of these options play differently and there are many different ways
         you can build-craft within each subclass. There is a lot to cover so I will let you get into it.
        <br>
        Click on the class symbols below to learn more about each class and their sub-classes.
